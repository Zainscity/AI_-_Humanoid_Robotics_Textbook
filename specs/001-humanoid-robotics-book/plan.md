# Implementation Plan: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

**Branch**: `001-humanoid-robotics-book` | **Date**: 2025-12-07 | **Spec**: [specs/001-humanoid-robotics-book/spec.md](specs/001-humanoid-robotics-book/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-humanoid-robotics-book/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This project is to create a comprehensive technical book, "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — From Digital Intelligence to Embodied Agents". The book will cover the design, simulation, and AI control of humanoid robots using ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems. The final output will be a manuscript in Markdown, optimized for Docusaurus and deployed on GitHub Pages.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.10+, C++17+ (for ROS 2), Markdown
**Primary Dependencies**: ROS 2 Humble, Gazebo 11, Unity 2022.3, NVIDIA Isaac Sim 2023.1, Docusaurus 3, Git
**Storage**: N/A (Content is stored in Markdown files within a Git repository)
**Testing**: Code samples will be tested manually for reproducibility. Automated testing is not in scope.
**Target Platform**: The book content will be deployed as a static website on GitHub Pages. The code examples target Ubuntu 22.04.
**Project Type**: Documentation (Book)
**Performance Goals**: N/A
**Constraints**: All code samples must be reproducible on the specified target platform and hardware.
**Scale/Scope**: The book will be 25,000–40,000 words, structured into 4 modules, a capstone project, and appendices.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- ✅ All chapters must be written using a spec-first workflow via Spec-Kit Plus. (Met)
- ✅ All factual claims must be checked against reliable and verifiable sources. (Will be met during writing)
- ✅ All external information must be cited using APA or standard developer-documentation style, depending on context. (Will be met during writing)
- ✅ Zero tolerance for plagiarism — all writing must be original and fully attributed. (Will be met during writing)
- ✅ Code samples must be tested, valid, and reproducible. (Met by constraint)
- ✅ Each chapter must maintain consistent tone, structure, and terminology across the book. (Will be met during writing)
- ✅ Illustrations, diagrams, or examples generated by AI tools (Claude Code, Claude Artifacts, etc.) must be explicitly labeled as AI-assisted. (Will be met during writing)
- ✅ All content must be optimized for deployment via Docusaurus and GitHub Pages. (Met by plan)
- ✅ Every chapter must include a brief “Sources & References” section. (Will be met during writing)
- ✅ All changes must be tracked via Git with meaningful commit messages. (Met by workflow)

**Structure Decision**: The project will follow a standard Docusaurus project structure. The book content will reside in the `docs` directory, organized by modules.

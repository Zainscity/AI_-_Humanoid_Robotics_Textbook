  "description": "For tasks that take a long time to complete and need to provide feedback along the way, neither topics nor services are a perfect fit. ROS 2 provides another communication pattern called actions for exactly these scenarios. Actions are the backbone of complex robotics behaviors like navigation, manipulation, and executing multi-step sequences.",

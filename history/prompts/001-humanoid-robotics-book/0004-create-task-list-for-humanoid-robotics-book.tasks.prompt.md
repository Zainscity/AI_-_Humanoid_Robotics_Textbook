## Prompt

read /sp.plan and continue where we left

## Response snapshot

I have created the `tasks.md` file based on the plan and the existing file structure. This file now contains a detailed breakdown of tasks for developing the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book".

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a detailed task list for book content creation.
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests were run, manual verification of tasks.md content.
- 📁 Files: One file created: specs/001-humanoid-robotics-book/tasks.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Next step would be to start implementing the tasks in `tasks.md`.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully translated plan into actionable tasks, following the template and project structure.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): null
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): null
